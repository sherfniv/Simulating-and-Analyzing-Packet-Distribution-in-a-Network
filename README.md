# Simulating-and-Analyzing-Packet-Distribution-in-a-Network
A Python-based simulation of network traffic across 1,024 computers, modeling packet generation, routing, and size using probabilistic distributions. The project visualizes data flow, byte distribution, and traffic heatmaps to analyze network behavior.
